# Umbraco Commerce v15.0.0-rc

Umbraco Commerce v15.0.0-rc is the initial release of Umbraco Commerce for Umbraco CMS v15. Because of 

## Key Takeaways

* Everything is now [async](#async).
* [Storefront API](#storefront-api) aligned with Management API
* A number of [Umbraco v15 updates](#umbraco-v15-updates).

## Async

The key focus of this release is the move to a fully asynchronous code base. To reduce the maintenance burden, the decision was made to go fully async without maintaining backward compatibility. This will therefore require code updates to use the new async methods.

### Previous behavior
Previously all C# API's were synchronous and thus blocking by nature.

```csharp
// Fluent API example
order.AddProduct(productRef, 1)
  .SetPaymentMethod(paymentMethodId)
  .SetShippingMethod(shippingMethodId);

// Service method examples
orderService.SaveOrder(order);
emailTemplateService.SendEmail(emailTemplateId, order);

// Notification events
public class MyNotification : NotificationEventHandlerBase<OrderFinalizedNotification>
{
  public override void Handle(OrderFinalizedNotification evt)
  {
      // Implement your custom logic here
  }
}
```

### New behavior
All API's are now asynchronous and thus are suffixed with Async and return a Task<T> result

```csharp
// Fluent API example
await order.AddProductAsync(productRef, 1)
  .SetPaymentMethodAsync(paymentMethodId)
  .SetShippingMethodAsync(shippingMethodId);

// Service method examples
await orderService.SaveOrderAsync(order);
await emailTemplateService.SendEmailAsync(emailTemplateId, order);

// Notification events
public class MyNotification : NotificationEventHandlerBase<OrderFinalizedNotification>
{
  public override Task HandleAsync(OrderFinalizedNotification evt, CancelationToken cancelationToken)
  {
      // Implement your custom logic here
  }
}
```

## Storefront API

When implementing the Management API in v14 we learnt a lot about API structure, and also found some common models between the Management API and the Storefront API. To aid with maintenance, and align approaches, the Storefront API was updated to similar patterns.

For the most part the API should stay the same, the key different being changes in operation IDs allowing the Storefront API to be used with client generators.

## Umbraco v15 updates

As well as the async works, Umbraco Commerce v15 has also been updated to depend on Umbraco v15 which consists of the following updates.

* Runs against .NET 9
* Variants property editor supports content variants

## What to Test and How to Give Feedback

We would welcome feedback on any installation / upgrade issues along with bugs found in any of the completed sections as detailed above.
