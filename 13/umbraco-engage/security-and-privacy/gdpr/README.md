**You can be GDPR compliant out of the box.**

## Privacy is our concern

Umbraco Engage principles:

* Umbraco Engage uses specific retention periods and personal data is not kept longer than necessary.
* Umbraco Engage has set up its software according to the principles of privacy by design and by default.

## GDPR Compliance

Umbraco Engage has been designed with the principles of privacy by design and privacy by default in mind. For example, the following measures have been taken:

* The retention period for **the Umbraco Engage cookie is 365 days by default**.
* The data is **anonymized after two years**, and **fully deleted after three years**.
* The IP address is pseudonymized by default.
* The use of view and click behavior is optional.
* Neither Umbraco Engage nor any other third party has access to the data\
  (except for, for example, custom hosting provider), as the cookie is first\
